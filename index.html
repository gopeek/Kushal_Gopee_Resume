        <p>No bug like the coding bug.</p>

        <p>I never really understood my dream. I enjoyed coding growing up but never thought it would take me anywhere in life. Sure I figured a combination of Math and a bit coding could make me a prime time candidate for teaching. Well at least that is what I did when I started out my professional career path.</p>
          
        <p>But I just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different. Allow my mind to be creative.</p>
          
        <p> And that's when it happened; the spark to my ignition the instant I clicked "How to build a website with HTML5 and CSS3" I was hooked the love for code came back, Since then the ship has sky rocketed for me. Software engineering calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate branch obviously)</p>
          
          <p> I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still looking amazing. It is oddly satisfying. Additionally creating JSON based API to connect to the front-end. I think in a way I'm kind of like those web pages; I'm moldable , but I still keep my creative flare intact.</p>
          
            <p> My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, responsive design principles, website optimization, and the Model View View Model (MVVM) and Model View Controller (MVC) methods including the famous REST API architecture methods of organizing code.</p>
          
              <p> So far I have JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC Python, jQuery, Bootstrap, ReactJs, Grunt, UX/UI design on Figma, Business Analysis, Project Management and Git/GitHub under my belt. I've started learning Node.Js, MongoDB, and Express.JS. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head. </p>

                     <p class="semi-bold">Webmaster</p> 
                  <p>I worked as a Web Master at Firewater, my job was vast which involved me working in many aspects of the Web.
                    I started off with creating landing pages using (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Jquery and Bootstrap) for various clients. 
                    Once I mastered the art above I moved onto working with CMS systems such as Umbraco and Sitefinity which is an ASP.Net framework as well as WordPress. My task here was to assist with development and testing. I was tasked with ensuring the website is responsive this involved writing responsive CSS code, fixing JavaScript code to ensure website functionality was up to customer standards, using additional libraries to assist with animations and ensuring that web sites were lightweight.</p>
                    
                    <p>Once I mastered the above I got introduced to the SEO side of digital marketing where eventually I was tasked with working on Google is SEO tools such as tag manager, analytics, web master tools as well as Facebook analytics. My task was to place tags which uses Javascript to track user clicks and activities this data was collected and used to give clients feedbacks about their customers.</p>
                    
                    <p>Additionally I assisted with taking user information in CSV format and segmenting them which ultimately lead to that data being uploaded onto mass emailing systems to blast off email campaigns towards customers.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also got the opportunity to help code email signatures and assist with coding mailers which is not as easy as it seems as it uses HTML tables and legacy CSS and the mailers had to work over multiple clients such as (Outlook, Gmail, iMail etc)</p>

                  <p>I would test the different requests and provide feedback to the developers and project managers and advice on where the message broke or passed and what the possible issue is.</p>
